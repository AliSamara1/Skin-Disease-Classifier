# ðŸ§ª Skin Disease Classifier

A deep learning model to classify skin disease types from dermatoscopic images using CNNs in TensorFlow.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

- Source: [Kaggle HAM10000 Skin Lesion Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kmader/skin-cancer-mnist-ham10000)
- ~10,000 dermatoscopic images
- 7 diagnosis classes (`nv`, `mel`, `bkl`, etc.)

## ðŸ§  Objective

To train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to accurately classify skin lesions into their respective categories for potential use in medical screening support.

## ðŸ§ª Approach

- Used Google Colab + TensorFlow
- Preprocessed images based on metadata
- Built and trained a CNN from scratch
- Evaluated using accuracy, loss, and confusion matrix

## ðŸ“ˆ Results

- Accuracy: *Coming soon*
- Confusion matrix: *Coming soon*
- Training loss/accuracy curves: *Coming soon*

## ðŸ§  What I Learned

- How to preprocess real-world image data
- How CNNs handle classification problems
- Dealing with class imbalance and image loading

## ðŸš€ Future Work

- Add transfer learning to boost performance
- Test on unseen data
- Deploy as a simple web demo
